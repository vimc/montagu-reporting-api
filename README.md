# Montagu Reporting API

See [spec.md](/src/app/src/test/resources/spec/spec.md) for the full API specification.

## Developing
System requirements:
* openjdk 8
* Docker

1. Make sure you check out recursively, using `git clone --recursive URL`.
2. Install Docker and add your user to the Docker group 
   (e.g. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04.) 
   You may need to restart your machine for changes to take effect.
3. Configure your Docker client to use our registry by following instructions 
   here: https://github.com/vimc/montagu-ci#configuring-docker-clients-to-use-the-registry
4. Run all dependencies (API, DB, Orderly Server, etc.) with 
   `./dev/run-dependencies.sh`
5. Run the reporting API with `./gradlew :run`

### Generate test data.  
This is done automatically by `run-dependencies.sh` above. To generate a test
Orderly directory to develop against, run the `:app:generateTestData` gradle
task (either from within your IDE or on the command line from within the project
root directory with `./gradlew:app:generateTestData`).

The above task will generate two Orderly directorys; one at `./src/app/demo`
and one at `./src/app/git`. The latter contains an Orderly directory which is
also a git repo, the former contains several different types of report. These
are used for integration tests and for running locally.

### Run tests
To run the tests, use `./gradlew test` having first run `run-dependencies.sh`  

## Docker build
The Teamcity build
1. Pulls in artifacts `demo` and `git` from the Orderly container build.
2. Runs `./scripts/make-build-env.sh` which builds a Docker image containing the source code and dependencies.
3. Runs `./scripts/build-app.sh` which uses the above image, mounting the `demo` folder as a volume, to compile code, run tests (for this purpose also running an Orderly Server image with the `git` folder mounted as a volume) and build a Docker image containing the compiled app code.

To build the image locally you will have to replace step one with generating the `demo` folder in your project directory following instructions here: https://github.com/vimc/orderly/tree/master/docker

## Docker run
To make use of a built image, run:

        docker pull docker.montagu.dide.ic.ac.uk:5000/montagu-reporting-api:master
        docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v {PATH_TO_ORDERLY}:/orderly docker.montagu.dide.ic.ac.uk:5000/montagu-reporting-api:master

replacing `{PATH_TO_OPRDERLY}` with an absolute path to an Orderly directory.
